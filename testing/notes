database - hold images - could be from users or fta:



web api in functions for app user flow:

    get item (id)
    get auction (id)
    get location (id)
    get user (username - generated id for obfuscation)
    create user
    update user
    delete user


user flow:

    app -> web api functions -> firestore / database -> app

    app -> web api functions -> firestore / database -> app



automated flow:
    cron -> non-api functions -> task queue / handlers -> firestore / database / notifications
