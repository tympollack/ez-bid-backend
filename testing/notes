database - hold images - could be from users or fta:



web api in functions for app user flow:

    get item (id)
    get auction (id)
    get location (id)
    get user (username - generated id for obfuscation)
    create user
    update user
    delete user


user flow:

    app -> web api functions -> firestore / database -> app

    app -> web api functions -> firestore / database -> app



automated flow:
    cron ->
        calls app engine function ->
            publishes pubsub topic ->

                function listens to pubsub topic ->
                    does work or ->
                    adds to task queue ->
                        activates handlers ->
                            publishes pubsub topic ->

                                firebase function ->
                                    (firestore / database / notifications)
